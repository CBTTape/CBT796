Hello Sam,

I hope things are going ok with you and family, and that you are
feeling better.

The "bug" in my Rexx exec was that it wouldn't work with ISPF
screen depth < 32.   I put in a simple check for that.  Now it is
fine.

Perhaps it would be helpful to add this to the title/description,
something similar to this?

The file contains a Rexx exec to explore D522 abends, and a Rexx
assembler function to write SMF records.

The Rexx assembler function I found somewhere, no idea who the
original author was, that writes SMF records, but unfortunately
it used a "Magic SVC"  to jump to supervisor state to do it.
Unacceptable.  I simply changed it a bit so that it uses BPX1SMF.
Now in order to use it the user must be given access by being
permitted to BPX.SMF resource in the Facility Class.  I also
added some additional error checks.

Thank you so much for all the work you've done over the years
with CBT. All great stuff.

Take good care,

Kind regards,

Lindy
