Hello Sam,

I hope you are all doing well during these trying times.  Things
are quite ok here in Finland.

I wanted to send you the updates to my FILE796.  It was for a
Rexx exec that displays ASCB and related control blocks, and I
fixed a bug plus added a flag that says whether the address space
is dubbed or not.

I like this one especially because it was my interesting solution
to how to put an entire ISPF application into one single Rexx
exec.

Take good care, and please be well,

Kind Regards,
Lindy Mayfield
